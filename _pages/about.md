I am a CNRS research faculty in the
[CompBio](https://tree-timc.github.io/compbio) subgroup of
[TrEE](https://www.timc.fr/en/tree) in the TIMC laboratory in Grenoble. I am
interested in **machine learning** and **causal inference** methods to better
understand **structure, function, regulation, and evolution of genomes**.


## Scientific computing activities

I am a contributor in a number of scientific computing libraries in Python including:

- [scikit-learn](scikit-learn.org) - Machine learning in Python.
- [matplotlib](matplotlib.org) - a python 2D plotting library.
