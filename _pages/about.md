## Machine learning and causal inference for -omics data

I am interested in **machine learning** and **causal inference** methods to
better understand **structure, function, regulation, and evolution of
genomes**. I develop methods to discover hidden patterns in large datasets,
often related to next-generation sequencing technologies.

Some of the projects that are currently keeping me busy are:

- **Machine learning methods to discover novel secretion system types**, with
  Sophie Abby.

- **Understanding how proteins evolve**, through the development of
  unsupervised learning techniques to uncover patterns of co-evolution in
  protein sequences, with Ivan Junier.

- **Transcriptomic-guided inference of proteomic missing data**, with Lucas
  Etourneau and [Thomas
  Burger](https://sites.google.com/site/thomasburgerswebpage)

## About me

I am a CNRS research faculty at the Universit√© Grenoble Alpes's TIMC
laboratory, in the TrEE team. Specifically, I am part of the
[CompBio](https://tree-timc.github.io/compbio) subgroup TrEE, also known as
CompBio@TrEE. TrEE is a large interdisciplinary team interested in anything
related to evolution, from the evolution of specific pathways to experimental
evolution (via the study of the Long Term *E. coli* Evolution Experiment). The
CompBio@TrEE is composed of three permanent researchers (Sophie Abby, Ivan
Junier, and myself) as well as many postdocs, PhD students, and interns.



## Scientific computing activities

I am a contributor in a number of scientific computing libraries in Python including:

- [scikit-learn](scikit-learn.org) - Machine learning in Python.
- [matplotlib](matplotlib.org) - a python 2D plotting library.

## Joining the lab


We're always looking for students from a wide range of background (statistics,
computer science, biology) to join our lab for internships! If the possibility
of being a part of our community interests you, don't hesitate to look at our
current [internship, PhD, and postdoc
opportunities](https://tree-timc.github.io/compbio/joinus/) or simply reaching
out to me directly (e-mail:  firstname [dot] lastname [at]
univ-grenoble-alpes [dot] fr), detailing your profile and what you are
interested in.
