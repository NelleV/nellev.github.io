## Machine learning and causal inference for -omics data

I am interested in **machine learning** and **causal inference** methods to
better understand **structure, function, regulation, and evolution of
genomes**. I develop methods to discover hidden patterns in large datasets,
often related to next-generation sequencing technologies.

Some of the projects that are currently keeping me busy are:

- **Inferring the 3D structure of the genome**, both haploid and diploid, at
  high resolution (in collaboration with the [Noble lab, University of
  Washington](noble.gs.washington.edu/) and [CBIO, École des Mines de
  Paris](https://cbio.ensmp.fr/))

- **Understanding how proteins evolve**, through the development of
  unsupervised learning techniques to uncover patterns of co-evolution in
  protein sequences, with Ivan Junier.

- **Transcriptomic-guided inference of proteomic missing data**, with Lucas
  Etourneau and [Thomas
  Burger](https://sites.google.com/site/thomasburgerswebpage)

## About me

I am a CNRS research faculty at the Université Grenoble Alpes's TIMC
laboratory, in the TrEE team. Specifically, I am part of the 
[CompBio](https://tree-timc.github.io/compbio) subgroup TrEE, also known as
CompBio@TrEE. TrEE is a large interdisciplinary team interested in anything
related to evolution, from the evolution of specific pathways to experimental
evolution (via the study of the Long Term E. Coli Evolution Experiment). The
CompBio@TrEE is composed of three permanent researchers (Sophie Abby, Ivan
Junier, and myself) as well as many postdocs, PhD students, and interns.



## Scientific computing activities

I am a contributor in a number of scientific computing libraries in Python including:

- [scikit-learn](scikit-learn.org) - Machine learning in Python.
- [matplotlib](matplotlib.org) - a python 2D plotting library.

## Joining the lab


We're always looking for students from a wide range of background (statistics,
computer science, biology) to join our lab for internships! If the possibility
of being a part of our community interests you, don't hesitate to look at our
current [internship, PhD, and postdoc
opportunities](https://tree-timc.github.io/compbio/joinus/) or simply reaching
out to me directly (e-mail:  firstname [dot] lastname [at]
univ-grenoble-alpes [dot] fr), detailing your profile and what you are
interested in.
